Despite a lack of farmable land, Afghanistanâ€™s economy is based largely on agriculture, with opium cultivation accounting for around 10% of the GDP. Although the country has mineral resources, it lacks the capability to make economic use of them. Illegal mining has funded both Taliban and anti-Taliban forces.",
