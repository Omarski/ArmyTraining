So when you are invited to somebody’s home, even if it’s not for a meal, then they will definitely feed you something. You’ll always get offered tea or a soft drink, and there will be some food involved with that. Even in these small interactions, you never want to refuse, because it’s culturally really insulting to somebody if you refuse something that they offer you. So even if you just have one cookie, eat the cookie. Or take one sip of the tea. But don’t refuse to have anything because it’s just really hurtful to the host.\""
