And that is with every relationship that you have. For many men, maintaining honor often means to make sure that they are really seen as the head of the family and imposing their will upon their family members. And the same thing with maintaining their honor in the workplace and maintaining their honor among friends. Oftentimes, you will see people doing something that is maybe detrimental to themselves or another family member, but if it means that they are going to maintain their social standing or their honor amongst the community, then they will do that.\""
