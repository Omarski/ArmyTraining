      "text" : "In societies that lean toward individualism, more focus is put on the individual and not the group. In these societies, the individual takes priority over the group. Individual needs are addressed first and group membership is not essential to survival or well-being. Individuals who grow up in a more individualist society are more likely to voice their opinions or dissension. In addition, competitiveness is a quality seen in individualistic societies much more than collectivist ones. The U.S., England, Germany, and Australia are generally seen as individualistic societies.",
