Culture adapts to the environment, but there is no one-to-one correlation. So we may have multiple different cultural approaches to a similar challenge. You can see that biologically, things like coping with high altitude or cold. You can also see that socially, coping with scarce resources, coping with family structure, coping with all the sorts of challenges that humans face. The funny thing is that two groups may have different cultural adaptations to deal with the same challenge. Both of them see them as perfectly normal, and they see the other one as unusual, as odd, as weird. That's human, that's normal.\""
