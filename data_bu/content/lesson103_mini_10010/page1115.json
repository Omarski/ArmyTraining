In monochronic societies, time is seen as a commodity that can be spent or saved. Because of this, punctuality, promptness, and respect for schedules are highly valued. In addition, people from monochronic societies tend to address one issue at a time. The U.S. generally leans toward a monochronic time orientation.",
