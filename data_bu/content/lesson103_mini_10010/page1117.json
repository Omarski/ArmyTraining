This is called \"polychronic\" time. Societies with this outlook are less concerned about rigid schedules, punctuality, and promptness. Fluid schedules with flexible start and end points are more the norm. In addition, people from polychronic societies often discuss multiple issues at a time and communicate in a cyclical fashion.",
