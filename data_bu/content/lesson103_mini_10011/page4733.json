And we were sitting around one evening and I said to them, 'So, let's say you were deploying some soldiers from your country to come to the United States. What are maybe some do's and don'ts that you might say to your soldiers?' And they thought about it for a minute or two, and they kind of looked at each other, they were reluctant to say anything, and I pushed them and said, 'Come on, come on, give me a do.' And one foreign officer said, 'Oh, that's easy. Do be on time. Do have a good haircut. These things are really important when you work with the U.S. Army.' And I said, 'OK, thanks. How about a don't?' And again they all looked at each other and one finally spoke up and said, 'Oh, that's really easy. Don't have a better solution. Americans always have the best solution.' That's a pretty telling comment. We tend to be kind of ethnocentric, and we need to check ourselves. It's not always the best way.\""
