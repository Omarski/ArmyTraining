And so we look to build our training in order to be able to provide the type of sensitivities that people need in order to adjust to those types of training. It's not that we don't value language, we certainly do. But our concentration in language is really probably really is in three areas. We want to have a high proficiency for our foreign area officers, a high proficiency for our crypto-analysts. We are looking to get conversational proficiency for our special operations and our expeditionary command forces. And really for the remainder of the Navy, we really are concentrating more on what we call 3C, the cultural sensitivity aspect of it. So that when we engage people overseas, our sailors will do so in a positive way. In the Navy we like to say that there is no better ambassador than a sailor and we want to make sure that we enable that sailor to be an effective ambassador in all types of situations.\""
