These feelings are often coupled with more difficult emotions, such as anxiety and fear. Everyone experiences culture shock when introduced to a new culture, but the degree to which one experiences it will vary based on personality, personal experiences, and preparation. Culture shock can often leave a negative impact on individuals. This impact often takes the form of disorientation, frustration, and depression.",
