      "text" : "When working in a new culture, individuals need to be aware of stereotypes, prejudice, and biases. Stereotypes are inaccurate generalizations about a group based on opinions and assumptions. Like stereotyping, prejudice is also based on opinions and assumptions, but it deals more with preconceived judgments about a particular group. A bias is a preference or inclination for or against others that is rooted in prejudice. Stereotypes, prejudice, and bias can impair objective thinking and judgment. Because of this, it's important that individuals avoid using stereotypes and practice self-awareness. This way, personal prejudices or biases will have less of an effect on their thinking.",
