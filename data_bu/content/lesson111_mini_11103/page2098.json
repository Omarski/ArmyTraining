You start thanking them, or express your gratitude for everything. You definitely compliment the food, the presentation and the quality of the food. And then you take your leave by asking for permission to leave. So, traditionally, in Urdu, the phrase that’s used literally translates to, 'May I ask your permission to leave?' So somewhere in that ballpark where you want to get that expression out, where you’re basically asking the host for their permission to leave, and doing it while being very polite and thanking them for the evening or for the meals.\""
