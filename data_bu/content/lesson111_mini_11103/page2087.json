After an appropriate amount of time, you can indicate that it's been a pleasurable meeting and that you need to take your leave. Express that you're looking forward to meeting again.\n\nSay goodbye by shaking the hand of the highest ranked official at the meeting, and then move on to the lower ranked attendees in descending order. Be sure to thank them for any hospitality they've shown you.",
