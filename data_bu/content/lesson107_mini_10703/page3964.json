The first Muslim dynasties arose in the mid-7th century C.E. and the region was ruled by small Islamic dynasties until Genghis Khan invaded from the east in 1219. Most of Afghanistan became part of his empire. After his death in 1227, the empire fell apart and was again broken up into principalities.",
