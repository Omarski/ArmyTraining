And it also became associated with a political party. And because of that, it’s now a sensitive term. It’s not something that you would go up to somebody and [say], like, ‘Hey, Muhajir.’ You wouldn’t say that. It’s not something that you would really apply in everyday language. Because those people themselves aren’t considering themselves refugees. I think you could just say that somebody is Urdu-speaking, rather than calling them a ‘Muhajir.’ The implication is that they are probably from a Muhajir family, but it's a more polite way to say that.\""
