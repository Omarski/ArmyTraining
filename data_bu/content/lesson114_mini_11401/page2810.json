Being aware of cultural taboos, being aware of cultural—or just even having a basic sense of knowledge about the culture and region’s history. Definitely, it plays a huge role in what your own experience is going to be like, as far as your perceptions go, as far as your expectations go. At the same time, on the other side, there’s also general cultural understanding. That’s more of a universal concept: having an understanding of what your own biases are, what your own expectations are about other cultures. And once you go there, just being aware of the fact that a lot of things are done differently and not completely writing them off as being strange or wrong, per se, when you go there. So just having that self-awareness or self-knowledge of your own mentality and your own understanding of how others act or behave makes your experience a lot different.\""
