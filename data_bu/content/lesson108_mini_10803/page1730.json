Especially in Karachi, where in the ‘90s, you saw literally a civil war between two of the ethnic groups. And that was mainly the Pathans and the Muhajirs. And that’s because there were rival political parties driving that tension. So you will have target killings, parties killing members of other parties. And all of these parties have street gangs that are aligned to them. So you’ll see gang warfare too, and then definitely you will see a lot of biases and stereotypes that people in everyday interactions will have with people from different ethnic groups.\""
